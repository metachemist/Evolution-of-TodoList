## Prompt

Create a Prompt History Record file in the constitution directory to document the work improving the constitution file to make standards more specific and production-ready.

## Response snapshot

This PHR documents the effort to improve the constitution file to make standards more specific and production-ready. The work involves reviewing the current constitution file and enhancing it with more precise and actionable standards that better reflect production-ready practices.

Key areas of focus for improving the constitution include:
- Adding more specific technical standards and requirements
- Defining clearer acceptance criteria for code changes
- Establishing more detailed operational readiness requirements
- Enhancing non-functional requirements with concrete metrics
- Improving the risk analysis and mitigation frameworks
- Adding production-oriented validation and evaluation criteria

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: New PHR created to track constitution improvements for production readiness
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for PHR creation
- 📁 Files: Created new PHR file in constitution directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Will focus on actually implementing the constitution improvements
- 🧠 Reflection: Documentation of constitution improvement efforts is important for maintaining standards evolution

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None yet, this is documentation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable yet
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Actually review and improve the constitution file content
