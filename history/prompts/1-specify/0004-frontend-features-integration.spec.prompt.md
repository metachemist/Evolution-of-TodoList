## Prompt

Update the existing feature-02-fullstack-todo.md specification to incorporate frontend user stories and requirements.

## Response snapshot

Updated the existing Full-Stack Todo feature specification by incorporating detailed frontend user stories and requirements. The updated specification now includes comprehensive user stories for authentication flows, task management dashboard, task creation/editing, responsive design, and loading/error states. Added frontend-specific functional requirements, success criteria, key entities, dependencies & assumptions, and technology constraints.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Enhanced feature specification with comprehensive frontend requirements
- 🧪 Tests: Verification needed to ensure all requirements are testable
- 📁 Files: Updated existing feature specification
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation planning
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully integrated frontend requirements into existing spec

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Need to verify all requirements are testable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Enhancement of existing specification
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin planning implementation of enhanced requirements
