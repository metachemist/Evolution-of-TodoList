## Prompt

Update the existing feature-03-chatbot.md specification to incorporate detailed API specifications for task CRUD operations.

## Response snapshot

Updated the existing AI Chatbot feature specification by incorporating detailed API specifications for task CRUD operations.

- 🧪 Tests: Verification needed to ensure all requirements are testable
- 📁 Files: Updated existing feature specification
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation planning
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully integrated both chatbot and API requirements in one cohesive spec

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Need to verify all requirements are testable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Enhancement of existing specification
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin planning implementation of enhanced requirements
