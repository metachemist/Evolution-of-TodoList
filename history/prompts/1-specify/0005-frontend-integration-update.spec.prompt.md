## Prompt

Update the existing feature-03-chatbot.md specification to incorporate frontend integration requirements.

## Response snapshot

Updated the existing AI Chatbot feature specification by incorporating comprehensive frontend integration requirements. The updated specification now includes detailed user stories for authentication flow, task management dashboard, task creation/editing, responsive design, and loading/error states. Added frontend-specific functional requirements, success criteria, key entities, dependencies & assumptions, technology constraints, and out of scope items.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Enhanced feature specification with comprehensive frontend integration requirements
- 🧪 Tests: Verification needed to ensure all requirements are testable
- 📁 Files: Updated existing feature specification
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation planning
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully integrated frontend requirements into existing chatbot spec

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Need to verify all requirements are testable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Enhancement of existing specification
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin planning implementation of enhanced requirements
